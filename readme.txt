Well, when you put your all credentials into CodeShop -> Settings page and hit the save button then you should see
'Test Settings' button, better click on that to be sure your API credentials working okay, If you see success message after 
a while when you click 'Test Settings' button then you ready to go set up your shop, if you see failed mesage then you need

[forum](https://codeapple.softcoy.com/codeshop-amazon-affiliate/forum/) to ask anything about plugin related issues. You can also
ask on wordpress [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/codeshop-amazon-affiliate).


= How will I add products? =
Using menu CodeShop -> Add New products you can add products by searching by text / keywords or by entering
ASINs ( Amazon Standard Identification Numbers ). When you have search results you can select all
products or can select which ones you want to add, then click on 'Add Selected Products' to add your all selected products.
You should see success message when products are added and then hit the publish button and visit the post page to see your
added products. 

If you want to add products with your wordpress regular posts / pages then when you are in Posts -> Add New or
Pages -> Add New area then you should see 'CodeShop' button appeared above text editor at the same line where
you have your 'Add Media' button. Click on 'CodeShop' button and you should see modal window through where you
can search by text / keywords, when you have search results then you can select products which ones you want to show
with your posts and then click 'Add Shortcode' button, shortcode will be created automatically for you and will be added
in your post editor, then just hit the publish button and visit the post page to see your added products.

REMEMBER you can change all kind of front end products display as you want to show it by customizing templates.

= How will I edit products? =
Using menu 'CodeShop -> All Products' you see all added posts. Just click on edit post as like regular wordpress
posts you do edit, then you will see all your added products with the post in your edit screen and then you can remove them by 
selecting checkbox or add more by searching as your requirements.

= How to display all added product categories into Sidebar? =
In menu Appearance -> Widgets you should see 'Amazon Shop categories' widget , just drag and drop to your
sidebar area where you want to show all added product categories. REMEMBER if you added categories and don't
have posts yet into those categories then those categories will not be shown. So add posts into your added 
categories to see them into your sidebar. So categories with no post will not be shown.

= How can I update or modify one column / two columns / three columns / four columns product view templates? =
Well, still you didn't copy the whole folder 'amazonshop-templates' from plugin directory then just copy the folder into
your active theme directory, for better understanding after copy the folder in your active theme the new 'amazonshop-templates'
folder path should be as like wp-content/themes/{your-active-theme}/amazonshop-templates/, now you are safe to update or
modify templates, where you should see all customizable templates. 

Suppose, If you want to update / modify two columns product view template then just open the template file 'product-two-columns.php' and 
update it as you want to make it work and corresponding stylesheet for this template file will be found at same folder as 
'assets/css/product-two-columns.css' to add / update your stylesheet. Same way for other templates -

* template file 'product-one-column.php' will use the stylesheet 'assets/css/product-one-column.css'  
* template file 'product-three-columns.php' will use the stylesheet 'assets/css/product-three-columns.css' 
* template file 'product-four-columns.php' will use the stylesheet 'assets/css/product-four-columns.css' 

so one template file including its stylesheet update / modify will not affect others.

= So am I limited to display products only with one column or two columns or three columns or four columns view? =
Basically, you are not limited! Templates are added as standard so you can update them, suppose you want to
show more than four columns product view by updating template file 'product-four-columns.php' then you can just 
update / modify contents to show as 5 columns or 6 columns or whatever you prefer you can do but just don't change 
the template file name 'product-four-columns.php'  and its corresponding styesheet 'assets/css/product-four-columns.css'. 
So you can display products as you want just keeping the template file names unchanged.
